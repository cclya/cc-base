# Exp. of Time Series 
The whole course of Time Series Analysis (almost) I've done in basic data analysis is collected here, click and visit: üòÉüëá  

## exp1. Basic TSA-I
Experimental Purpose:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ To understand the characteristics of AR, MA and ARMA models. An in-depth study of the characteristics of each model, including their underlying assumptions, parameter structure, and data generating process, to understand how different models capture different dynamic features in time series data.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ To master the characteristics of the autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function. The autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) are key tools for identifying and building AR, MA, and ARMA models. Interpret the time series structure implied by these features by learning their graphical features, such as exponential decay, censoring, etc.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ To identify and establish the ARMA model according to the characteristics of the data set. By observing the ACF and PACF plots of the time series data, the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation structures of the data are identified. Based on these characteristics, an appropriate AR, MA, or ARMA model fits the data.

The data set is the number of female births per day in California in 1959, with 365 observations.

## exp2. Basic TSA-II
Experimental Purpose:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ To understand the characteristics of AR, MA and ARIMA models. An in-depth study of the characteristics of each model, including their underlying assumptions, parameter structure, and data generating process, to understand how different models capture different dynamic features in time series data.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ To master the ADF unit root test. By learning the ADF test principle and operation steps, master the sequence stationarity test.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ To identify and establish the ARIMA model according to the features of the data set. By observing the ACF and PACF plots of the time series data, the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation structures of the data are identified. Based on these features, an appropriate AR, MA, or ARIMA model is selected to fit the data.

üëâ Source: *China Statistical Yearbook* - The data set is the value-added data of the national tertiary industry from 1952 to 2022 (100 million yuan), 71 observed values in total.

## exp3. Seasonal ARIMA
Experimental Purpose:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ To understand the characteristics of the ARIMA model with seasonal variation. An in-depth study of the characteristics of each model, including their underlying assumptions, parameter structure, and data generating process, to understand how different models capture different dynamic features in time series data.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ To correctly identify the features and optimize the model parameters to establish the ARIMA model in line with the characteristics of the data set. By observing the ACF and PACF plots of the time series data, the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation structures of the data are identified. Based on these characteristics, the trend changes and seasonal fluctuations of the data are identified, the model is fitted accordingly, and the optimal model is selected according to AIC and SBC criteria.

üëâ Source: *China Statistical Yearbook* - The data set is the national monthly gross import and export data (USD 100 million) from 2010 to 2016, 84 observed values in total.

## exp4. Intervention Analysis Model & Transfer Function Model
Experimental Purpose:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ To understand the characteristics of time series dynamic models. The intervention analysis model and transfer function model can capture structural changes and response properties in time series data. By analyzing the trend, seasonality, cyclicality and the impact of external intervention in the data, these models can effectively help understand the internal law of variables changing over time.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ To master the method of using statistical software to establish dynamic models. Through practical data preprocessing, model identification and setting, parameter estimation, diagnostic testing and other operational steps, skilled use of statistical software to construct intervention analysis model and transfer function model, so as to achieve in-depth analysis and effective prediction of time series data.
